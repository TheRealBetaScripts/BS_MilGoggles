## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone this repository into your server's `resources` folder.
2. Add `ensure bs_milgoggles` to your `server.cfg` file.
3. Edit the `config.lua` to customize your setup.
4. Restart your server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

To integrate the goggles with your clothing system, use the following `Config.SkinChangeFunction`:

```lua
Config.SkinChangeFunction = function(value, gogglesOn) -- Hat/Helmet Skin ID, Goggles On Check
    -- Works with OUR fivem-appearance/inventory/metadata clothes system
    TriggerEvent('skinchanger:getSkin', function(skin)
        local compIndex
        for i = 1, #skin.props do 
            if skin.props[i].prop_id and skin.props[i].prop_id == 0 then 
                compIndex = i 
                break 
            end 
        end
        if not compIndex then compIndex = 1 end
        local updatedClothes = {["helmet_1"] = value, ["helmet_2"] = 0}
        skin.props[compIndex].drawable = value
        skin.props[compIndex].texture = 0
        TriggerEvent('skinchanger:loadClothes', skin, updatedClothes)
        TriggerServerEvent('fivem-appearance:save', skin)
    end)
    -- Probably will need to be changed for your clothes system
end
```

Example exports to use the goggles:

- **Equip Goggles**: `exports["BS_MilGoggles"]:PutGogglesOn(Config.Clothing.Gender.goggles[gogglesKey], true)`
- **Remove Goggles**: `exports["BS_MilGoggles"]:TakeGogglesOff()`

## üéÆ Usage

Players can equip and use military goggles in-game:

1. Add the goggles item to their inventory.
2. Use the configured keys to toggle night or heat vision.
3. Enjoy synchronized emotes with other players.
